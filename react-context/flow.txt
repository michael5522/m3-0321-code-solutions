User can sign up.
If user clicks "register"  route value becomes "#sign-up".
Since the path is "sign-up", the Auth.jsx page will be rendered.
If the user types a name and a password, it will be added into the database.


User can sign in.
If user clicks "sign in"  route value becomes "#sign-in".
Since the path is "sign-in", the Auth.jsx page will be rendered.
After the user types in his name and passowrd, the database will check if the username and password matches.
If it does not match, an error is given. If it does, the user will be allowed access inside the website.

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).
If a user is still logged in, the "isAuthorizing" inside state will have a token so even a refresh will keep the current status quo unless user logs out and makes the "isAuthorizing" false.

User can sign out.
If user clicks "sign out",  the user in state becomes set to "null" & data from 'react-context-jwt' removed.
The page will default back to the sign-in/sign-up page.
